### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, my name is Douglas. I am a self-taught developer who has been working in the industry since 2011. I have experience in both frontend and backend development, but recently, I have been focusing mainly on the frontend. While I do not have a preferred framework, I find that I am most productive when using React. I am particularly passionate about functional programming, so Elixir, ReScript are my favorite languages at the moment.
