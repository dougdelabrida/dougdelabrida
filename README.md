### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As you probably have noticed, my name is Douglas. I've been working as a self-taught developer since 2011, both on the backend and frontend sides, being the last years mainly focused on the frontend. Even though I don't have a pet framework, I feel more productive using React + ExpressJS. I'm enthusiastic about functional programming using Javascript.

##### About me

```elixir

  pronouns: "he/him",
  from: "Brazil",
  livingIn: "Portugal",
  workingAt: "hightop.com",
}
```
