### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, my name is Douglas. I am a self-taught developer who has been working in the industry since 2011. I have experience in both frontend and backend development, but recently, I have been focusing mainly on the frontend. While I do not have a preferred framework, I find that I am most productive when using React and NodeJS. Currently, I'm investing some time on Elixir, ReScript and Rust.

##### About me

```elixir
douglas = %{
  pronouns: "he/him",
  from: "Brazil",
  livingIn: "Portugal",
  workingAt: "hightop.com",
}
```
